## Project Description
I have decided to program tictactoe because i have always enjoyed playing the game. It's simple and entertaining. Especially in school and university the game was always a good alternative to refresh boring classes

## Rules
1. The game is played on a board that's 3 squares by 3 squares with numbers on them. The numbers are assigned as follows: 1 - 2 - 3 (top row from left to right) 4 - 5 - 6 (middle row from left to right) 7 - 8 - 9 (bottom row from left to right)
2. Player 1 has X, Player 2 has O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of his/her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.

## Workflow
1. Research about the game. 
2. Designing game structure.
3. Thinking about possible difficulties.
4. Cloning Repo in GitHub
5. MAINPART: Coding the Game!
6. Testing
7. Updating Repo with READ ME.file and gitignore.file

## Organization
For organizing the different steps described in workflow i jused Trello.
For the presentation i used google slides.

My repositiory contains the following:
1. READ ME.file --> Shows you how to play the game.
2. gitignore.file --> Shows files to ignore from Git
3. Last and final version of my code
